# Test 
This is the anthem
Told the world I need everything and some, yeah
Two girls that's a tandem
She gon' do all it for me when them bands come
Got it all, yeah I'm young, rich, and handsome
Uh, this shit is not random
Everybody ain't got it, understand son, yeah
This shit is not random
Woah okay
## Test2
It's my world and I do what I like to
I know she gon' be ready when I slide through
If you forgot I got it, I'll remind you
'Cause I got what they got I am talking times two
Disagree with me and you've been lied to
I am nothing like you, and no I'm not the type to
Follow bullshit y'all give the hype to
I can see the fakes, so when I look in your direction
Understand I'm seeing right through
You're hollow, you follow
Everybody's not the real McCoy
Worldwide, yeah,â€¦
